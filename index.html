 <p>Hello! My name is Pavel Zapolski. I came to the United Stated about 10 years ago from Eastern Europe.
    My country is located right between Poland and Russia. It's a small country and if you open the map of eastern
    Europe you'll find out the name of it.</p>
 <p>As soon as I came here, I started taking English classes. It was difficult at first but it was a lot 
    of fun. Learning something new is always exciting, especially when you learn a new language. After finishing 
    all the ESL classes (English As a Second Language), I began taking classes for my major which was business 
    administration. And soon after I graduated from Bucks County Community College with an Associate degree. The next big 
    event in my academic life happened when I graduated from Temple University with Bachelor's Degree in Marketing.
    If you ask me why I chose marketing as a major, I will not be able to answer you that question. Maybe my teachers were teaching the
    courses so well that I decided to stick to the major. Maybe, material of the course was very interesting. Perhaps,
     combination of those two factors. But when I got my first job I was certain that this is not for me. After 
     about 6 month of thinking and going through a lot of choices what to do as well as talking to my friends and colleagues, I finally decided 
     to dive into the IT world. And to be honest, the more I get into it the more I love it.</p>
